* Use EPAâ€™s aquatic models to estimate pesticide concentrations in aquatic ecosystems. 
* Use deterministic and probabilistic approaches to simulate fate and exposure of pesticides.
* Identify the exposure and effects of pesticides on listed species under the Endangered Species Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
* Use probabilistic approaches to characterize variability and uncertainty  related to model parameters and variables (developed a MC shell wrapper to execute PRZM5 and VVWM models, sample input parameters and to characterize parameter sensitivity, using R)
* Support other project teams (used SWAT model to support  Hydrologic Micro Services infrastructure (HMS) team).
