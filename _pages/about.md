I am Sumathy Sinnathamby and I am an ORISE postdoctoral fellow at a US Environmental Protection Agency laboratory in Athens, Georgia. I am working with watershed modelers, engineers,  ecologists, chemists, statisticians, and programmers conducting research on environmental protection and sustainability. 

I have a multidisciplinary background and always brings this perspective to my work. I find that being able to look at problems from many perspectives help me "think outside box", enhance my creativity and innovation, and can lead to novel solutions. 

I am married to Muluken Muche and we have a beautiful daughter named Sophia. When not at work, I like to spend time with my family, play with my daughter, cook, read and watch movies. 

I believe in the Power of Helping Others. So if you need help, you can contact me to … discuss SWAT modeling (flow, crop and water quality parameters), pesticide modeling (PWC), and acquire/analyze remote sensing and GIS data.
