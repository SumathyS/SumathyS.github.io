I am Sumathy Sinnathamby and I am an ORISE postdoctoral fellow at a US Environmental Protection Agency laboratory in Athens, Georgia. I am working with watershed modelers, engineers,  ecologists, chemists, statisticians, and programmers conducting research on environmental protection and sustainability. 

I have a multidisciplinary background and always bring this perspective to my work. I find that being able to look at problems from many perspectives help me to understand problem in more depth, make connections between ideas and concepts, enhance my creativity and innovation, and can lead to novel solutions and high impact research. 

I am married to Muluken Muche and we have a beautiful daughter named Sophia. When not at work, I like to spend time with my family, play with my daughter, cook, read and watch movies. 

I believe in the power of helping others. So if you need help, you can contact me to discuss SWAT modeling (flow, crop and water quality parameters), pesticide modeling (PWC), and acquire/analyze remote sensing and GIS data.
