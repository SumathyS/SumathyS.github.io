Work experience
======
* Oct.2016-Present: ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow
  * US EPA/ORD-NERL-CED-Watershed Exposure Branch
  * Research activities: 
	* Use EPA’s aquatic models to estimate pesticide concentrations in aquatic ecosystems.  
	* Use deterministic and probabilistic approaches to simulate fate and exposure of pesticides.
	* Identify the exposure and effects of pesticides on listed species under the Endangered Species Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
	* Use probabilistic approaches to characterize variability and uncertainty  related to model parameters and variables (developed a MC shell wrapper to execute PRZM5 and VVWM models, sample input parameters and to characterize parameter sensitivity, using R)
	* Support other project teams (used SWAT model to support  Hydrologic Micro Services infrastructure (HMS) team) 

* Aug. 2015 – Feb. 2016: Engineering Associate
  * Kansas Department of Agriculture,Division of Water Resources, Manhattan, KS. 
  * Duties included:
	* Support the division’s mission to develop and analyze water management strategies on basin and regional scales.
	* Use a variety of water rights and hydrologic information from different sources to produce decision support products including, maps, charts, tables, and narratives to help explain the causes of water resource challenges and to help understand the effects of proposed management strategies.
	* Assemble water use data, water quality data, and any other relevant data, and aid in drafting the report on the performance of the Intensive Groundwater Use Control Areas (IGUCA). 
	* Review Water Conservation Plan (WCP) and send it to Chief Engineer’s for his approval. 
	* Assist Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) report production.
	* Use ArcGIS, MODFLOW, Microsoft Excel, and other computer software tools as needed.
	* Collaborate with a variety of project team members and partners including: division headquarters and field office staff, and USGS.
	* Process the municipal water use reports and follow up with municipal staff as needed to ensure that the water use data is correct and complete.

* May.2015 –Aug. 2015: Residential Adviser and Lead Teacher
  * Flint Hills Job Corps, Manhattan, KS
  * Duties included:
	* Built relationships with the residents in the community; assisted residents in developing relationships with each other and accountability for their behavior; served as a resource; provided helping skills for residents in need; and supported other staff.

* Aug. 2010-Sep. 2014: Graduate Research Assistant
  * Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Kansas State University
  * Research activities:
	* Collaborated with Department of Agronomy and Department of Agricultural Economics staff of the Kansas State University on various watershed modeling projects including: Kansas National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR, USDA Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), and South Central Region Sun Grant Program.
	* Collaborated with engineering student and multidisciplinary staff at University of Kansas to develop watershed models.
	* Worked on projects related to surface water resource modeling; multi-objective calibration and validation for better simulation of flow (both low and high), crop yield, nutrients and sediment; processing and analyzing historical climate and hydrology data; watershed level ecohydrological characterization; linking ecohydrological changes and biotic variables (fish species) at watershed scale; landuse impact and crop price based crop rotation on water quality; ecosystem quantifications; best management practices effectiveness; biofuel and climate change impacts; and chemometric determination of top soil organic carbon and total nitrogen.  
	* Co-authored in Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy (WRAPS) Project Final Reports. Kansas Dept. of Health and Environment, Bureau of Water. Topeka, KS.
 
* Jan. 2008- May. 2010: Graduate Research Assistant
  * Department of Civil Engineering, Boise State University
  * Research activities:
	* Conducted watershed scale research related to land use impacts, climates change on water quality and quantity;  modeled hydrological projections using downscaled precipitation and temperature outputs from a suite of global climate models and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); and used GIS and remote sensing products (AMSR-E) to model soil moisture at state level (Nebraska).
