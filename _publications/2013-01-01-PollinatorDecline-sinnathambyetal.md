In this paper we present a holistic evaluation of impacts and responses to pollinator decline in the US in an effort to summarize the spatial and temporal state of US pollinators, to review possible pressures and drivers of national pollinator decline, to examine the agro-socio-economic impact of the state of pollinators, and to provide a comprehensive insight into associated problems and solutions.
